		<b>Volapük</b> was created in 1879 by Johann Martin Schleyer - a German priest - and was the first International Auxiliary Language to achieve popularity, with language clubs appearing in many countries. 
		This was short-lived, however, as Esperanto became more popular in the beginning of the 20th century. 
		In 1931, the Dutch doctor Arie de Jong, took steps to revive and reform the language, and Volapük enjoyed a brief period of interest, interrupted by the Second World War. 
		Afterwards, Volapük has maintained a small, but loyal community until today, when it again began to be more popular, thanks to the Internet.

		<b>Volapük Fasilik</b> is an attempt to update the language, removing the inconsistencies that appeared over the time. It aims to further the reforms of Arie de Jong, while keeping as many previous elements as possible, for backwards compatibility.
		Its goal, first of all, is to present a simpler version of the language for the beginner, since the number of people who actually learn and use the language is small, compared to the total of people showing interest in Volapük.
		The proposed way to do this is to add elements to the existing foundation and development that already occured in Volapük over the years.
		Its proposals, among others: new words with international forms, new roots where the source language contains the letter R (which previously avoided), and a reform of the affixes, which sees the fall into disuse of the rarely used prefixes and suffixes.
